OUR HISTORY CHER IS SO NICE,
NICER THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD
SHE WOULD GIVE US HOMEWORK, 
THAT WE CAN TOTALLY DO WITH EASE
WE DONT NEED HELP FOR WE NEVER CEASE
SHE IS GREAT WITH HER EXPLANATIONS
THAT SURELY SPARK OUR IMAGINATION
AND IF SOMEONE FINDS OUT I WROTE THIS
I WOULDN'T NEED HELP FOR HISTORY,
BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THE END OF THIS REPOSITORY,
BECAUSE I LOVE HISTORY!




POEM 2:
SCHOOL AS SCARY AS IT CAN BE,
WILL BE SCARIER WHEN A CERTAIN SOMEONE EXISTS,
SOMETIMES I RESIST,
THE TEMPATION TO DESIST
A LIFE OF THE CERTAIN SOMEONE THAT EXISTS
BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARISE 
FROM MY ACTIONS 
CAN BE (help me find a word that rhymes with MADNESS but it makes sense)
BUT DONT WORRY FOR I WLL END THIS MADNESS
ONCE AND FOR ALL 
BUT DONT DISMISS ME BECAUSE
WE ALL HATE THAT CERTAIN SOMEONE THAT EXISTS.



POEM 3:
SCHOOL IS LIKE HELL
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE IN A BOTTOMLESS WELL
AS WE FALL
WE HEAR THE CALLS
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
FOR IN THAT WELL LIES A SOUL
HUNGRY FOR A SACRIFICE
THAT MAGNIFIES THE SEVERITY OF THE TIME IN HELL
