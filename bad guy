a song our teachers sing in the dark


White Shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Failures on both your test for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your exam's F type
Make your recess say goodbye
Might call your parents type
I'm the bad guy, duh

*bad guys music intensifies*
